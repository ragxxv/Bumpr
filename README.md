# Requirements:
+ A Discord account to be used as bot. <br />
+ A bump reminder bot, there are numerous available for this purpose. <br />
+ DMs opened with the Disboard bot, this allows to fetch the slash command. <br />

# How it works:
Anytime the bot is pinged by the operator or the reminder bot, it sends the bump slash command. <br />
The operator must ping the bot once for setting up the reminder, which automatically loops the bump for future.

# Setup:
Fill out details needed in bot.py as **strings**. <br />
That's it, you're welcome.
